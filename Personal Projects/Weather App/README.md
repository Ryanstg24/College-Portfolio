<h1>Weather App</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This project is a weather application built using JavaScript and React. It leverages two APIs, namely OpenWeather API and GeoDB Cities API, to fetch weather data and city information. The application aims to provide quick and efficient weather information in a user-friendly manner.</p>

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>VS Code</strong></li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript</strong></li>
  <li><strong>React</strong></li>
  <li><strong>OpenWeather API</strong></li>
  <li><strong>GeoDB Cities API</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits in a Professional Setting</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: The use of VS Code as the code editor, along with JavaScript and React, enables efficient development and ensures clean, maintainable code. This proficiency in widely-used tools can lead to improved productivity and streamlined workflows in a professional setting.</li>
  <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface</strong>: The project prioritizes a user-friendly experience, allowing individuals to quickly access and understand weather information. This attention to usability demonstrates an understanding of user-centered design principles, which is highly valued in professional environments.</li>
  <li><strong>API Integration</strong>: Integrating external APIs, such as OpenWeather API and GeoDB Cities API, demonstrates the ability to work with third-party services and leverage their functionalities. This skill is essential in professional settings where integrating external data sources is often required.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem Solving and Overcoming Challenges</h2>

<p>During the development of this project, a challenge was faced with the API data not being displayed despite successful network traffic. After thorough investigation, it was discovered that the issue originated from a typo in the <code>App.js</code> file. The <code>currentWeatherFetch</code> function was misspelled, resulting in the data not populating as intended. By identifying and rectifying this error, the project was able to display the expected API data correctly.</p>

<p>This problem-solving example showcases the ability to troubleshoot issues, identify bugs, and implement appropriate solutions. In a professional setting, these problem-solving skills are valuable for maintaining and debugging complex codebases.</p>
