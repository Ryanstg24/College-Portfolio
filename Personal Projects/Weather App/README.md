<h1>Weather App</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This project is a weather application built using JavaScript and React. It leverages two APIs, namely OpenWeather API and GeoDB Cities API, to fetch weather data and city information. The application aims to provide quick and efficient weather information in a user-friendly manner.</p>

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>VS Code</strong>: The project was developed using Visual Studio Code, a popular and powerful code editor. It provides a rich set of features, including syntax highlighting, debugging capabilities, and extensions, which enhance productivity and streamline the development process.</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: The project is primarily written in JavaScript, a widely-used programming language for building web applications. JavaScript enables dynamic and interactive features on web pages, making it an essential tool for front-end development.</li>
  <li><strong>React</strong>: The project utilizes the React library, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. React allows for efficient and reusable component-based development, making it easier to manage complex UI structures and ensure a smooth user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenWeather API</strong>: The OpenWeather API is integrated into the application to retrieve weather data. It provides accurate and up-to-date weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. By leveraging this API, the application can display real-time weather conditions for a given location.</li>
  <li><strong>GeoDB Cities API</strong>: The GeoDB Cities API is used to fetch city information, such as city names, geographical coordinates, and other relevant data. This API enhances the user experience by providing accurate city suggestions and ensuring accurate weather data retrieval.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits in a Professional Setting</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: The use of VS Code as the code editor, along with JavaScript and React, enables efficient development and ensures clean, maintainable code. This proficiency in widely-used tools can lead to improved productivity and streamlined workflows in a professional setting.</li>
  <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface</strong>: The project prioritizes a user-friendly experience, allowing individuals to quickly access and understand weather information. This attention to usability demonstrates an understanding of user-centered design principles, which is highly valued in professional environments.</li>
  <li><strong>API Integration</strong>: Integrating external APIs, such as OpenWeather API and GeoDB Cities API, demonstrates the ability to work with third-party services and leverage their functionalities. This skill is essential in professional settings where integrating external data sources is often required.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem Solving and Overcoming Challenges</h2>

<p>During the development of this project, a challenge was faced with the API data not being displayed despite successful network traffic. After thorough investigation, it was discovered that the issue originated from a typo in the <code>App.js</code> file. The <code>currentWeatherFetch</code> function was misspelled, resulting in the data not populating as intended. By identifying and rectifying this error, the project was able to display the expected API data correctly.</p>

<p>This problem-solving example showcases the ability to troubleshoot issues, identify bugs, and implement appropriate solutions. In a professional setting, these problem-solving skills are valuable for maintaining and debugging complex codebases.</p>
